# 🚗 CarGuru Pro Repository

Welcome to the CarGuru Pro Repository! This repository is part of a MiBA Esade assignment for Streamlit. Below you will find a detailed description of the purpose of this repository and the files it contains.

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to develop and deploy a Streamlit application that utilizes machine learning models to predict car prices. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and creating an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## 📁 Repository Contents

### 📂 `logos`
This folder contains logo images used in the Streamlit application.

### 📄 `MLmodel.ipynb`
This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training the machine learning model. This file contains only the line of thinking for the data exploration. 

### 📄 `car_price_dataset.csv`
This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model. The dataset includes various features related to car prices.

### 📄 `first_app.py`
This Python script contains the code for the initial version of the Streamlit application.

### 📄 `rf_model.pkl`
This pickle file contains the trained Random Forest model used for predicting car prices.

### 📄 `rf_model.py`
This Python script contains the code for training the Random Forest model and saving it as a pickle file.

## 🚀 How to Run the Streamlit Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ricksuarez29/CarGuruPro.git

2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. streamlit run first_app.py
