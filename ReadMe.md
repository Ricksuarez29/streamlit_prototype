# Python Prototypes Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of prototype assignments developed as part of my MSc in Business Analytics in ESADE. Here, you’ll find two distinct projects showcasing data visualization, application development, and innovative integrations with large language models (LLMs).

## 📁 Projects Overview

### **Streamlit Prototype (`streamlit` folder)**
This project is built purely with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and demonstrates:
- **Files**: Core Python scripts, assets, and configuration files.
- **Requirements**: A `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies needed to run the project.
  
### **Streamlit + LLM Prototype (`streamlit+LLM` folder)**
This project takes the Streamlit experience further by integrating a large language model (LLM). It includes:
- **Files**: Python scripts, prompt configurations, and assets to drive LLM interactions.
- **Requirements**: A `requirements.txt` file that covers both Streamlit and the additional LLM dependencies.
