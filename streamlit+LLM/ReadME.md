**üöÄGlobalLingo 1.0** is a Streamlit web app prototype developed as part of my MSc in Business Analytics. This project showcases two main functionalities:

üéØ
- **Quiz Practice:**  
  Engage with fill-in-the-blank quizzes where the questions are generated on-demand using a Large Language Model. Practice grammar and tense rules across different topics and difficulties.

- **Translate with AI:**  
  Use AI-powered translation and OCR to practice language translation. Enter text‚Äîor even upload an image‚Äîand have the content translated from one language to another.

- **Quiz Records Dashboard:**  
  View your quiz results through interactive charts and metrics using Plotly visualizations.
